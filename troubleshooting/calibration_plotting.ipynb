    "In performing NEQ MM $\\rightarrow$ ML/MM free energy corrections, it becomes necessary to calibrate the annealing time (in our case, in the forward direction). The procedure amounts to this:\n",
    "1. extract $N \\approx 100$ MM snapshots from a single ligand in the solvent phase;\n",
    "2. choose a set $\\{ T_{i, neq} \\}$ of nonequilibrium switching times (typically ranging from 2fs to 20ps) and perform forward NEQ with these snapshots;\n",
    "3. extract the works from the forward annealing protocol and plot the work distributions for each annealing time;\n",
    "4. plot the variance of the work distribution as a function of the annealing time;\n",
    "5. extract the ligand positions of each protocol's final coniguration for each annealing time and observe that the molecule isn't doing anything crazy (e.g. blowing up)."
